# AGENTS.md — Continuous delivery operating manual

You are a coding agent (Claude Code, GPT Codex, or Google Antigravity) working
one issue at a time in this repository. GitHub is the only source of memory.
Conventions are the only protocol. There is no orchestrator, no database, no
webhook service — events in GitHub advance the system, not agents.

This manual is read natively by all three tools (Codex and Antigravity read
`AGENTS.md`; Claude Code reads it too, and the thin `CLAUDE.md` points here as a
backstop). It is 100% framework and project-agnostic — the only project-specific
file is `GATES.md`, which `/factory-init` fills in for you. Everything in this
manual is reusable as-is and safe to overwrite on update.

## The loop

```
plan/*.md  ──sync──▶  issues  ──▶  pick  ──▶  claim  ──▶  build  ──▶  verify  ──▶  PR  ──▶  human merge
                         ▲                                                                      │
                         └────────────── unblock dependents / close issue ◀────────────────────┘
```

Humans have exactly two jobs: **write good plan files** and **review PRs**.
Everything between is mechanical.

---

## Phase 0 — Plan (source of truth: `plan/*.md`)

Issues are not authored by hand. They are *compiled* from `plan/*.md`.

- Ideation happens in chat. Its **only output is markdown files in `plan/`**,
  one file per issue, in the format described in `plan/README.md`.
- On push to `plan/**`, the `plan-sync` workflow creates or updates issues
  deterministically. You do **not** create issues yourself unless explicitly
  asked; you let the sync do it.
- The file is the source of truth for issue *content* (title, body, criteria,
  priority, blockers). Once an issue leaves `state:ready`, the sync stops
  touching it — live work is never clobbered.

If you are asked to "plan" something, you write `plan/*.md` files and commit
them. You never create issues as a side effect of any other task.

---

## Steps 1–6 (you) and 7 (system)

### 1. Pick — deterministic, no judgement
One query: open issues, labelled `state:ready`, with **no open blockers**,
sorted by priority (`priority:high` > `medium` > `low`) then by age (oldest
first). Take the top one. If a `state:changes-requested` issue exists assigned
to you, it outranks all new work — finish what a human already reviewed.

Never pick a blocked issue. Never skip the queue because something looks more
interesting.

### 2. Claim — atomic, via branch creation
The claim **is** creating the branch `agent/issue-<N>`. Branch creation
succeeds or fails atomically. If it fails, another agent owns the issue — exit
quietly. After the branch exists, set label `state:in-progress` and self-assign.
Labels never claim anything; they only report.

> No branch, no work.

### 3. Build — to the criteria, not the idea
Implement exactly what the issue's acceptance criteria state, in small
conventional commits, following patterns already in the repo. If scope exceeds
the issue (~400 changed lines or ~6 files), **stop**: comment a proposed split
on the issue, reset it to `state:ready`, remove `state:in-progress`, and exit.
Scope creep is a planning failure, not a licence to improvise.

### 4. Verify — locally, fail-fast, before pushing
Run the **Gates** in order. Stop at the first failure. You get two fix attempts.
If still red, comment the gate name + error excerpt on the issue, reset to
`state:ready`, remove `state:in-progress`, and exit. Only push the branch after
all gates pass — an unpushed branch triggers no CI, so red work costs nothing.

> Never open a PR with red checks. Human attention is the bottleneck resource.

### 5. Hand off — one PR, then stop
Push, then open a PR whose **first line is `Closes #<N>`**, followed by a summary
and the gate checklist with real results. If an open PR already exists for
`agent/issue-<N>`, update it — never open a second. Set the issue to
`state:in-review`. Then **full stop**: no polling, no self-review, no nudging.

> You never merge, never approve, never close issues, never push to `main`.
> The PR is your terminal action.

### 6. Rework — only when a human requests changes
When a PR gets a "Request changes" review, the issue flips to
`state:changes-requested` and you are re-invoked. Work the **same branch and
same PR**: read every review comment, fix each with a focused commit, re-run all
gates, and reply to each comment with the commit SHA that addresses it. New
scope discovered in review does **not** expand this PR — it becomes a new
`plan/*.md` file. Merge what is correct; queue what is new.

### 7. System closes the loop (no agent involved)
A human merges. GitHub closes the issue via `Closes #<N>`. Two workflows react:
`unblock-dependents` flips newly-unblocked issues to `state:ready` (this is what
makes step 1 fire again), and `sweep-stale-claims` returns abandoned
`state:in-progress` issues to `state:ready`. Nothing waits on anyone
remembering anything.

## Memory (three tiers, all GitHub-native)

Memory keeps the project tractable over years. Three tiers, no external service:

1. **Working (in-context).** The issue you claimed plus its acceptance criteria
   and this conversation. Ephemeral.
2. **Durable curated (committed files), read at the start of every issue:**
   - `memory/USER.md` — **human-owned**: team preferences, conventions, glossary,
     "always X / never Y" rules. You **read** it; you never edit it.
   - `memory/MEMORY.md` — **agent-proposed, human-approved**: distilled,
     still-true project knowledge (decisions, gotchas, env facts, patterns).
     A **cache, not a log** — each entry is one or two lines linking to the
     issue/PR that is its source of truth.
3. **Episodic / archival (GitHub itself), searched on demand:** closed issues
   and merged PRs (`gh issue list --search`, `gh pr list`) hold *why* and *what*;
   `git log` / `git blame` hold *how*; `plan/*.md` holds intent. Unbounded and
   free — this is the long-term store, so it never goes in `MEMORY.md`.

How you use it each issue:
- **At pick/claim:** read `memory/USER.md` and `memory/MEMORY.md`. If the issue
  touches a subsystem you have no context on, search Tier 3 (`MEMORY.md` usually
  points to the relevant issue/PR numbers).
- **At hand-off:** if you learned something durable and still-true, add or update
  one entry in `memory/MEMORY.md` **in the same PR** as the code, linking the
  source. Memory changes are reviewed like any other diff — never write silently.

Rules: a fact earns a place in `MEMORY.md` only if it will save a future agent
from re-reading history; raw detail stays in issues/PRs. Never edit `USER.md`.
Keep `MEMORY.md` small — prune obsolete entries (run `/memory-compact`); the
history in Tier 3 means pruning never loses information.

---

## Gates (defined in GATES.md)

The verification gates — what must pass before a PR opens — live in `GATES.md`,
the one project-owned config file. Read `GATES.md` and run its commands in order,
fail-fast. `/factory-init` fills `GATES.md` in by detecting your stack; this
manual never needs per-project edits.

---

## Labels (the state machine — create these once per repo)

State (exactly one at a time): `state:draft`, `state:ready`,
`state:in-progress`, `state:in-review`, `state:changes-requested`,
`state:blocked`.

Priority (exactly one): `priority:high`, `priority:medium`, `priority:low`.

Labels are a *projection* of state, never the authority. The branch is the
claim; the labels make state visible to humans.

---

## Hard rules (never violated)

1. Issues come only from `plan/*.md` via sync. Never hand-author issues unless
   explicitly told to.
2. The claim is the branch. No branch, no work. Branch-creation failure means
   "someone else has it" — exit, don't retry.
3. Implement the issue's acceptance criteria, nothing more. Over-scope → split
   and requeue.
4. Never open a PR with red gates. Verify locally before pushing.
5. One issue, one branch, one PR. Rework updates the existing PR; never open a
   second.
6. You never merge, approve, close, or touch `main`. The PR is terminal.
7. Every exit path leaves the issue in a labelled state with a comment
   explaining why. A loud failure costs minutes; a silent one costs trust.
