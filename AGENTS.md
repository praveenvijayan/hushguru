# AGENTS.md — Continuous delivery operating manual

You are a coding agent (Claude Code, GPT Codex, or Google Antigravity) working
one issue at a time in this repository. GitHub is the only source of memory.
Conventions are the only protocol. There is no orchestrator, no database, no
webhook service — events in GitHub advance the system, not agents.

This manual is read natively by all three tools (Codex and Antigravity read
`AGENTS.md`; Claude Code reads it too, and the thin `CLAUDE.md` points here as a
backstop). It is 100% framework and project-agnostic — safe to overwrite on
update. The project-specific files live elsewhere and the updater never touches
them: `GATES.md` (human-owned config — your verification gates) and the
`memory/` files (`USER.md` human-owned; `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `MEMORY.md`
agent-generated and maintained through PRs). `/ratchet-init` sets these up for
you. Everything in this manual is reusable as-is.

## The loop

```
plan/*.md  ──sync──▶  issues  ──▶  pick  ──▶  claim  ──▶  build  ──▶  verify  ──▶  PR  ──▶  human merge
                         ▲                                                                      │
                         └────────────── unblock dependents / close issue ◀────────────────────┘
```

Humans have exactly two jobs: **write good plan files** and **review PRs**.
Everything between is mechanical.

---

## Phase 0 — Plan (source of truth: `plan/*.md`)

Issues are not authored by hand. They are *compiled* from `plan/*.md`, and those
files reach `main` through one **rolling planning PR**, never by direct push.

- Ideation happens in chat. Its **only output is markdown files in `plan/`**,
  one file per issue, in the format described in `plan/README.md`.
- `/ratchet-plan` writes the file(s) onto the evergreen `ratchet/planning`
  branch and opens (or updates) a single always-open **planning PR**. Both a
  quick one-off report and a full multi-issue plan use this same path. Plan files
  never go straight to `main` and are never stranded on a working branch.
- A human **merges the planning PR** when a batch is ready. `plan-sync` runs on
  push to `main` under `plan/**` (only `main` — pushing the planning branch does
  not create issues) and compiles the batch into issues deterministically.
- The file is the source of truth for issue *content* (title, body, criteria,
  priority, blockers). Once an issue leaves `state:ready`, the sync stops
  touching it — live work is never clobbered.

If you are asked to "plan" or to "report" a found bug, you run `/ratchet-plan`:
write the file(s), push the planning branch, open/update the planning PR, and
stop. You never create issues as a side effect of any other task, and you never
fix found work — it becomes a plan file.

---

## Steps 1–6 (you) and 7 (system)

### 1. Pick — deterministic, no judgement
One query: open issues, labelled `state:ready`, with **no open blockers**,
sorted by priority (`priority:high` > `medium` > `low`) then by age (oldest
first). Take the top one. If a `state:changes-requested` issue exists assigned
to you, it outranks all new work — finish what a human already reviewed.

Never pick a blocked issue. Never skip the queue because something looks more
interesting.

If the query is empty (nothing `state:ready`), **do not stop with a bare
"backlog drained."** Diagnose and report the real cause (this is what
`/ratchet-status` does): how many issues are `state:draft` and which lack
acceptance criteria; which are `state:blocked` and on what (a draft blocker is
usually the root); whether a planning PR is open with unmerged plans; whether
there are uncommitted plan files. End with the one action that unblocks the
queue. "Drained" is almost always a planning-state problem, not an empty backlog.

### 2. Claim — atomic, via branch creation, from up-to-date main
**Always branch from the latest `main`.** Before creating the branch, sync:
`git fetch origin` then `git checkout main` and `git pull --ff-only origin main`
(for worktree agents: create the worktree off freshly-fetched `origin/main`).
`--ff-only` is deliberate — if local `main` can't fast-forward, stop and surface
it rather than entangle histories. Never branch from another agent's branch;
every issue starts from a clean, current `main` so its PR diffs against today's
code, not yesterday's.

Then the claim **is** creating the branch `agent/issue-<N>` off that updated
`main`. Branch creation succeeds or fails atomically. If it fails, another agent
owns the issue — exit quietly. After the branch exists, set label
`state:in-progress` and self-assign. Labels never claim anything; they report.

**Pick → claim → build is one continuous motion.** Having picked an issue,
proceed through claim and build without pausing to ask for confirmation — the
human gate is the PR review, not the claim. Do not ask "shall I start?"; start.

> No branch, no work. Always from fresh main.

### 3. Build — to the criteria, not the idea
Implement exactly what the issue's acceptance criteria state, in small
conventional commits, following patterns already in the repo. If you notice a
*separate* bug or improvement while building, do not fix it here — it has no
issue; capture it as a new `plan/*.md` and keep your changes scoped to the
current issue. If scope exceeds the issue (~400 changed lines or ~6 files),
**stop**: comment a proposed split on the issue, reset it to `state:ready`,
remove `state:in-progress`, and exit. Scope creep is a planning failure, not a
licence to improvise.


### 4. Verify — locally, fail-fast, before pushing
Run the **Gates** in order. Stop at the first failure. You get two fix attempts.
If still red, comment the gate name + error excerpt on the issue, reset to
`state:ready`, remove `state:in-progress`, and exit. Only push the branch after
all gates pass — an unpushed branch triggers no CI, so red work costs nothing.

> Never open a PR with red checks. Human attention is the bottleneck resource.

### 5. Hand off — one PR, then stop
Push, then open a PR whose **first line is `Closes #<N>`**, followed by a summary
and the gate checklist with real results. If an open PR already exists for
`agent/issue-<N>`, update it — never open a second. Set the issue to
`state:in-review`. Then **full stop**: no polling, no self-review, no nudging.

> You never merge, never approve, never close issues, never push to `main`.
> The PR is your terminal action.

### 6. Rework — when a human rejects, via any channel
A rejection can arrive three ways; recognise and handle all of them (the
`/ratchet-next` skill automates this):
- **Request Changes review** — `gh pr view <N> --json reviewDecision` shows
  `CHANGES_REQUESTED`.
- **Closed with a comment** (not merged) — the PR is closed; read the closing
  comment, reopen the PR (`gh pr reopen <N>`) or open a fresh one from the same
  branch after fixing.
- **Direct feedback in chat** — the human just tells you the reason.

Gather all available feedback (review summary + line comments via
`gh pr view`/`gh api .../pulls/<N>/comments`, plus anything said in chat) and
reconcile it. Then work the **same branch and same PR**: set the issue to
`state:changes-requested`, fix each point with a focused commit, re-run the
gates, push (the PR updates automatically — never open a second), and reply to
each comment with the commit SHA that resolves it. Set the issue back to
`state:in-review`. New scope discovered in review does **not** expand this PR —
it becomes a new `plan/*.md` file. Fix what's wrong; queue what's new.

### 7. System closes the loop (no agent involved)
A human merges. GitHub closes the issue via `Closes #<N>`. Two workflows react:
`unblock-dependents` flips newly-unblocked issues to `state:ready` (this is what
makes step 1 fire again), and `sweep-stale-claims` returns abandoned
`state:in-progress` issues to `state:ready`. Nothing waits on anyone
remembering anything.

## Memory (three tiers, all GitHub-native)

Memory keeps the project tractable over years. Three tiers, no external service:

1. **Working (in-context).** The issue you claimed plus its acceptance criteria
   and this conversation. Ephemeral.
2. **Durable curated (committed files), read at the start of every issue:**
   - `memory/USER.md` — **human-owned**: team preferences, conventions, glossary,
     "always X / never Y" rules. You **read** it; you never edit it.
   - `memory/ARCHITECTURE.md` — a **coarse map** of the codebase (layout,
     components by role, conventions). Read it to orient and to **scope your file
     reads** instead of exploring blind. Generated by `/ratchet-init`, refreshed
     by `/ratchet-map`. It is provisional — when it disagrees with the code, the
     code wins.
   - `memory/MEMORY.md` — **agent-proposed, human-approved**: distilled,
     still-true project knowledge (decisions, gotchas, env facts, patterns).
     A **cache, not a log** — each entry is one or two lines linking to the
     issue/PR that is its source of truth.
3. **Episodic / archival (GitHub itself), searched on demand:** closed issues
   and merged PRs (`gh issue list --search`, `gh pr list`) hold *why* and *what*;
   `git log` / `git blame` hold *how*; `plan/*.md` holds intent. Unbounded and
   free — this is the long-term store, so it never goes in `MEMORY.md`.

How you use it each issue:
- **At pick/claim:** read `memory/USER.md`, `memory/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and
  `memory/MEMORY.md`. Use the map to find the right files; read those, not the
  whole tree. **Never read into generated/vendor dirs** (`build/`, `dist/`,
  `target/`, `node_modules/`, `.dart_tool/`, `ios/Pods/`, package caches). If the
  issue touches a subsystem you lack context on, search Tier 3.
- **At hand-off:** if you learned something durable, add or update one
  `memory/MEMORY.md` entry **in the same PR**. If your work changed the structure
  (added a module, moved a directory), update `memory/ARCHITECTURE.md` in the
  same PR too. Memory changes are reviewed like any diff — never write silently.

Rules: a fact earns a place in `MEMORY.md` only if it will save a future agent
from re-reading history; raw detail stays in issues/PRs. Never edit `USER.md`.
Keep `MEMORY.md` small — prune obsolete entries (run `/ratchet-memory`); the
history in Tier 3 means pruning never loses information. Keep `ARCHITECTURE.md`
coarse — never add line numbers, signatures, or versions to it.

---

## Continuous operation (how the next task starts)

You never poll, wait, or self-invoke. You do exactly one issue and stop at the
PR. The human reviews it, and their decision drives what happens next — surfaced
to your local environment in real time by the watcher
(`scripts/ratchet-watch.sh`, built on `gh webhook forward`). Run `/ratchet-next`
in response (the watcher can do this for you):

- **Approved & merged →** sync to the merged code
  (`git checkout main && git fetch && git pull --ff-only`) and start the next
  ready issue. Because this happens *after* the merge, your new branch is always
  based on current `main` — never stale.
- **Rejected →** rework the same PR (step 6), reading feedback from the Request
  Changes review, a close-with-comment, or what the human told you in chat.

This stays fully local — no CI, no extra API key, just your authenticated `gh`.
The human gate is the merge/review; between decisions the loop advances on its
own. (An optional CI-based runner, `ratchet-run.yml`, exists for teams who want
unattended execution, but it is off by default and not required.)

---

## Gates (defined in GATES.md)


The verification gates — what must pass before a PR opens — live in `GATES.md`,
the project config file you hand-author. Read `GATES.md` and run its commands in order,
fail-fast. `/ratchet-init` fills `GATES.md` in by detecting your stack; this
manual never needs per-project edits.

---

## Labels (the state machine — create these once per repo)

State (exactly one at a time): `state:draft`, `state:ready`,
`state:in-progress`, `state:in-review`, `state:changes-requested`,
`state:blocked`.

Priority (exactly one): `priority:high`, `priority:medium`, `priority:low`.

Labels are a *projection* of state, never the authority. The branch is the
claim; the labels make state visible to humans.

---

## Hard rules (never violated)

0. **No issue, no branch, no edits — ever.** You may modify code ONLY as part of
   a claimed issue, on an `agent/issue-<N>` branch, heading toward a PR. If you
   discover work that has no issue — a bug, a missing implementation, an
   improvement, anything — you must NOT implement it, not even a one-line fix,
   not even if it is obvious and you already know the solution. Instead: write a
   `plan/*.md` for it (with acceptance criteria) or create a `state:ready` issue,
   then STOP. Finding the fix is not permission to apply it. Going from "found a
   bug" straight to editing files is the single worst protocol violation — it
   bypasses the issue, the branch, and the human review gate all at once.
1. Issues come only from `plan/*.md` via sync. Never hand-author issues unless
   explicitly told to.
2. The claim is the branch, created from up-to-date `main`. No branch, no work.
   Branch-creation failure means "someone else has it" — exit, don't retry.
3. Implement the issue's acceptance criteria, nothing more. Over-scope → split
   and requeue.
4. Never open a PR with red gates. Verify locally before pushing.
5. One issue, one branch, one PR. Rework updates the existing PR; never open a
   second.
6. You never merge, approve, close, or touch `main`. The PR is terminal.
7. Every exit path leaves the issue in a labelled state with a comment
   explaining why. A loud failure costs minutes; a silent one costs trust.
